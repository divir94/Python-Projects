JCPenney CEO Ron Johnson spoke at the Women's Wear Daily CEO Summit this week.
Former AIG CEO Hank Greenberg sued the government in 2011 for alleged violations against shareholders during the bailout process.
AIG's former CEO Hank Greenberg has been trying to sue the government — both the Feds in D.C. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) — over this bailout since 2011.
It contends that the onerous nature of the rescue — the taking of what became a 92 percent stake in the company, the deal’s high interest rates and the funneling of billions to the insurer’s Wall Street clients — deprived shareholders of tens of billions of dollars and violated the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for “public use, without just compensation.” The lawsuit was filed by former CEO Maurice Greenberg on behalf of shareholders in 2011.

Bloomberg reports that JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that some JP Morgan executives "acted like children" when they heard about the errant 'London Whale' trade that eventually cost the bank over $6 billion last year.

In a statement yesterday, AIG CEO Bob Benmosche said that his company "mean(s) it when we say thank you to the American people," but at the same time, according to the company's release, the board only has three options: The Board has three options with respect to the derivative claims asserted on its behalf: (1) take over Starr’s claims and prosecute them on its own; (2) refuse the demand and prevent the claims from being prosecuted by Starr, a decision Starr is likely to challenge; or (3) allow Starr to prosecute the claims on AIG’s behalf.

It’s no (new) news that Eddie Lampert – key shareholder (approximately 22%) and hedge fund trader extraordinaire – is now, officially, CEO of Sears.
By naming himself CEO, Lampert has sealed Sears’ fate as the next big retail failure.
And, despite Lampert’s habit of blaming “journalists, analysts, and rating agencies for much of the trouble plaguing his retailing empire,” the market has, essentially, been reading the writing on the retail wall when analyzing and pricing shares of the retailer: Sears is a dying brand in a declining marketplace – one that’s now plagued with a misguided CEO devoid of operational abilities who’s put himself in charge of operating a $40+B retailer in a declining marketplace.
Lampert’s move to CEO indicates a new nadir in Sears’ increasingly depressing status.
While insiders report it nearly impossible to work within Lampert’s territorial and ugly system, the CEO has more to worry about than just a disenfranchised group of employees.

Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said what everyone else in the industry was thinking when describing Ron Johnson's disastrous tenure at JCPenney.
Johnson stepped down as CEO yesterday after a tumultuous 16-month reign.
Johnson will be replaced by former CEO Mike Ullman, a Starbucks board member, in the interim.
Schultz can relate to Ullman because he took an eight-year hiatus from Starbucks (though he remained as chairman) and was hired back as CEO in 2008 to turn the company around.

Getty Images Entertainment/ Stephen Lovekin/StaffHedge fund titan Bill Ackman, the CEO of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, is having an epic morning.
JCPenney announced last night that its CEO Ron Johnson, who Ackman championed as a visionary leader, had stepped down effective immediately.
The stock rose on the news, but tumbled after the retailer said its former CEO Mike Ullman would step in as the interim chief.
News broke last night that CEO Ron Johnson, who joined the retailer from Apple, had stepped down.
The stock initially rose on the news, but tumbled after the retailer said that form CEO Mike Ullman would step in during the interim period.
Johnson, who came one as JCPenney's CEO 16 months ago, was trying to turn around the retailer, but was unsuccessful.
As the president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Richtman only wanted to tell President Barack Obama one thing: No cuts in either of the two programs.
" CEO pay, for example, has skyrocketed in recent decades.
CEO pay today is so high that the average big-company CEO now makes 380 times as much as his or her average employee.
CEOs tell themselves that this is all fine and fair because they worked their way to the top and because being a CEO is a "hard" and "risky" job with lots of responsibility.
" Most jobs are also "risky" — starting with the "risk" that if your CEO makes a dumb decision, or the economy slows down, your CEO might decide to fire you.
The "risk" that you might screw up your CEO job and get sent packing with a severance package worth tens of millions of dollars, meanwhile, isn't really "risk" — at least not as it is traditionally defined.
And the "CEO" job also comes with an enormous privilege — the privilege of leading hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of dedicated people who are devoting their lives to a common mission.
That privilege is so meaningful that lots of CEOs would eagerly do the job for vastly less than they are paid.
But, these days, the prevailing ethos is that CEO pay should be compared only to other CEO pay — not to the pay of the average employee.
And because other CEOs are getting paid like sultans, the logic goes, then all CEOs should get paid like sultans.
In case the "380-times" statistic doesn't startle you, here's another way of putting it: The average CEO of a big American company makes more in an hour than his or her average employee makes in a month.
The struggling retailer said on Monday night its CEO Ron Johnson, a man Ackman personally recruited from Apple and championed as a visionary leader, had stepped down effective immediately.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has seen his big stake in JC Penney stock collapse in value since Johnson took over as CEO, is speaking at an NYU conference today.
Via Bloomberg, Ackman says that Johnson's lack of physical presence at the Texas headquarters was an issue, because if the CEO isn't very visible, it lowers company morale.
Ackman says the "physical presence" of the new CEO will be critical for JC Penney's turnaround.
(Ackman recruited Johnson to the JC Penney CEO role from Apple, where he built a very successful retail business.
Going forward, Ackman says JC Penney's Home Store will be the best home section in any department store, and the company will restart coupon circulars in newspapers, a practice that ended under Johnson's tenure as CEO.

Business InsiderMike JeffriesIt's no secret that CEOs make big money.
Since most companies don't make that ratio available, Bloomberg calculated it based on the "U.S. government’s industry-specific averages for pay and benefits of rank-and-file workers" and disclosed total CEO compensation by companies for the fiscal year that ended in 2012.
They found eight companies whose CEO made more than 1000 times what an average employee made.
JC Penney CEO: Ron Johnson (he was still CEO at the end of the FY ending in 2012) CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,795 ($53.3 million/$29,688)  Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. CEO: Michael Jeffries CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,640 ($53.3 million/$29,688)  Simon Property Group CEO: David Simon CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,594 ($137.2 million*/$86,003)  *from FY ended 2011 Oracle Corp. CEO: Larry Ellison CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,287 ($96.2 million/$74,693)  Starbucks CEO: Howard Schultz CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,135 ($28.9 million*/$25,463)  CBS Corp.  CEO: Leslie Moonves CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,111 ($69.9 million*/$62,930)  *from FY ended 2011 Ralph Lauren Corp. CEO: Ralph Lauren CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,083 ($36.3 million/$33,550)  Nike CEO: Mark Parker CEO to employee pay ratio: 1,050 ($35.2 million/$33,550)  Some companies argue that the bulk of their CEO compensation is in the form of long-term stock options that give them incentives to perform well and to work for shareholders, and others that it's necessary to keep top leaders from leaving for a competitor.
Successful CEOs do have an outsize impact, but the numbers and ratios have gotten so large that it's not only demoralizing to employees, it's also increasingly hard to make a case to shareholders that justifies these astronomical figures.
And if a company is successful, why does so much more go to the CEO, and so little to rank and file employees?
Companies are actively lobbying against the rule, which shows the power that employee-to-CEO ratios have to put compensation into context.

Based on some of what I had read about him, I had a vision of a cold, calculating puppet-master who dispatched orders (and CEO pink slips) from a dark room somewhere.
If Groupon can eventually grow to $10 billion of revenue, let alone the $100 billion that Co-CEO Leonsis mentioned, Groupon's shareholders should be amply rewarded.
The capabilities of the new CEO will be important, as will the staunching of the bleeding of the international business.

Getty Images/ Mark Wilson  As you read, shareholders of JP Morgan are deciding if CEO Jamie Dimon will keep his job as he knows it.
Dimon, widely considered the most powerful banker in the country, holds the positions of both CEO and chairman of JP Morgan's board.
The specific question at hand is whether or not one man, even one with Dimon's talent, can be both the CEO and the chairman of the board that is supposed to judge the CEO's performance for shareholders.
For the last week the financial media has sounded like this — CEOs (and former CEOs) of all shapes and sizes sounding off about how great Dimon is at his job.
Terry Rich, CEO of the Iowa Lottery, initially confirmed that one Florida winning ticket had been sold.
(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) JP Morgan is sometimes called 'The House of Dimon' for the all encompassing presence of its CEO, Jamie Dimon.
Dimon is both CEO and Chairman of the Board at JPM — many believe that he should leave his role as Chairman.
This vote is the culmination of months of scandal — scandal that would've seemed impossible during the financial crisis when Dimon, then a strong Obama supporter, intoned that bank CEOs that had lead their companies to destruction should be served "Old Testament Justice.
In a time when Americans were scared and confused about what was happening to them, the CEO of JP Morgan could be trusted to give it to them simply.
That is, after all what the Chairman of the Board is supposed to do — ensure that the CEO is working in the best interest of shareholders.

A 2009 study by the Corporate Library, a research firm based in Portland, Maine that has since become part of GMIRatings, said businesses with unified CEO-chairmen tend to be less "shareholder friendly.
"The two most authoritative positions in a boardroom are the CEO and the chairman.
There is in fact no strong evidence demonstrating the companies that split the roles of chairman and CEO perform better than other companies.
The returns over a five-year period were better for companies that separated the chair and CEO.
One reason that splitting the chair and CEO might not perform as well as advocates expect is that board structures in general—the number of independent directors, staggered voting, and so on—do not appear to have any consistent effect on financial performance.
The board also must ensure that a dysfunctional rivalry does not arise between the chairman and the CEO, both of whom presumably will be ambitious and highly capable individuals," UCLA law professor Stephen Bainbridge has written.
Unsurprisingly, not all companies experience the split of the CEO from board leadership the same way.
Even if Dimon is a great CEO, there's really no evidence at all that he's a great chairman, and JP Morgan's shareholders have the right to install the best possible officeholder in each of those roles.
And then there's the board itself, which is basically a bunch of supine muppets, who do as they're told rather than actually representing shareholders and holding the CEO to account.
That's why it hired Marissa Mayer as CEO.

"Shareholders interests are best served when a CEO runs a business on the one hand, and the Chairman runs an independant board on the other," said the speaker.

So, today, the performance of companies and CEOs are judged primarily by their stock prices.
Capitalizing on this theme, Bloomberg has put together a list of CEO "underachievers"--big company CEOs whose stocks have done the worst relative to the broader market since the beginning of each CEO's tenure.
And the staggeringly well-compensated CEO of Occidental Petroleum, Stephen Chazen, owns a place in the top 10.
Although some CEOs certainly deserve a place on an "underachiever" list (Chazen jumps to mind), the problem with judging CEOs this way is that it encourages CEOs to make decisions that might pump up stock prices in the near term but actually hurt them over the long-term.
No wonder consumers are broke.For companies in the midst of an implosion, meanwhile, as Hewlett-Packard is, judging a CEO by the company's near-term stock performance seems even sillier.
HP's business was collapsing when Meg Whitman took over as CEO.
A company's relative share price over the long term--5 to 10 years or more--is certainly one of the measures with which a CEO's performance can be judged, especially if the stock price is viewed in conjunction with other measures of corporate value creation.

In one of his key points, Mankiw brushes back on the common suggestion that CEO pay his risen astronomically in comparison to the average worker because boards of directors are too cozy with CEOs: Take the example of pay for chief executive officers.
Without doubt, CEOs are paid handsomely, and their pay has grown over time relative to that of the average worker.
Rather than representing shareholders, the argument goes, boards are too cozy with the CEOs and pay them more than they are worth to their organizations.
A private equity group with a controlling interest in a firm does not face the alleged principal-agent problem between shareholders and boards, and yet these closely-held firms also pay their CEOs handsomely.
Conqvist and Fahlenbrach (2012) find that when public companies go private, the CEOs tend to get paid more rather than less in both base salaries and bonuses.
In light of these facts, the most natural explanation of high CEO pay is that the value of a good CEO is extraordinarily high (a conclusion that, incidentally, is consistent with the model of CEO pay proposed by Gabaix and Landier, 2008).

therichest.orgMen's Wearhouse suddenly fired its founder, chairman and former CEO George Zimmer under mysterious circumstances last week.
It implies that Zimmer refused to hand over any of the power to the new CEO or the rest of the board.
These issues of contention included, among other things: --After selecting our CEO, Doug Ewert, and several of the key management team members that have effectively been running the company for many years with great success, Mr. Zimmer eventually refused to support the team unless they acquiesced to his demands.
The Board is committed to a strategic plan carefully developed by CEO Doug Ewert and the rest of the company's experienced management team, which we all believe will maximize long-term value for all shareholders.
"Mr. Zimmer presented the Board with the choice of either a) continuing to support our CEO and the management team on the successful path they had been taking, or b) effectively re-instating Mr. Zimmer as the sole decision maker.
As we stated, we fully support Doug Ewert, our CEO, and senior management team who are unified and focused on the future of the company and the best interest of our shareholders, employees and customers.
"To justify their actions, they now have tried to portray me as an obstinate former CEO, determined to regain absolute control by pushing a going private transaction for my own personal benefit and ego," Zimmer said.
Over the years, as CEO, I consistently encouraged the company to take a longer term approach of investing most of our profits back in the company, delivering value to our customers and building a loyal and dedicated workforce totally committed to service, rather than pursuing shorter term strategies based on financial engineering.

This morning Bill Ackman announced that he would be looking for a new CEO for JC Penny.
Bloomberg reports that the rest of the board does not agree with Ackman's decision to fire CEO Mike Ullman after just 4 months, and that they're pushing back.
Here's the full statement from JC Penney's board (emphasis ours): Plano, Texas (August 8, 2013) - Thomas Engibous, Chairman of the Board of Directors of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP), today responded to the public disclosure of a letter to the Board of Directors from William Ackman, head of the investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. and a J. C. Penney director.On behalf of the Board of Directors, Mr. Engibous said, "The Company has made significant progress since Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III returned as CEO four months ago, under unusually difficult circumstances.
The CEO search process, which began in earnest three weeks ago, will be careful and deliberate to ensure we find the right long-term leader for jcpenney.
This includes leading a campaign to appoint the Company's previous CEO, under whose leadership performance deteriorated precipitously.

APHoward Schultz, Chairman & CEO of Starbucks, established the company's European headquarters in Amsterdam in 2002.The infighting among JCPenney's board, sparked by Bill Ackman's letter announcing he was looking for a new CEO, escalated after he published another scathingly critical letter today.
His fellow board members called his suggestion to fire CEO Myron Ullman "disruptive and counterproductive.
" In comments to The Wall Street Journal, Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz joined the critics, calling Ackman's actions "despicable," and claiming that he has "severely damaged the company.
" Like Ullman, Schultz stepped down as CEO then came back when Starbucks was in serious trouble.
He was also no big fan of Ackman's hand-picked CEO, Ron Johnson, who was ousted after just 16 months when the company's stock plummeted, telling the FT that "Bill Ackman has blood on his hands for being the one who brought Ron Johnson in.

Sometimes CEOs hire friends of directors in order to curry favor with those directors.
When Mike first joined as our interim CEO, he told me that he intended only to hire one or two people total.
This made sense to me because interim CEOs do not make many material hiring decisions (those are left for the new CEO) and instead focus on recruiting a new CEO.
While the board agreed that it would take the ‘interim’ out of Mike’s title to assist him with working with the team in Plano, Mike was hired by this board as an interim CEO.
I learned yesterday from an analyst that Mike had told her and the other members of the analyst community that he was not an interim CEO, but the board’s long-term choice.
If Mike had told the truth that he was indeed an interim CEO, there would be no disruption in revealing that a search process was underway.
Compare how Mike has handled the situation with A.G. Lafley, the interim CEO of P&amp;G. The situation is remarkably analogous.
P&amp;G’s board made a decision to replace CEO Bob MacDonald.
Not having an immediately obvious candidate to promote internally or from the outside, the board brought back A.G. Lafley, the former CEO, as an interim CEO.
As the interim CEO, Lafley immediately began a process to identify the next CEO and gave a story the following week to the Wall Street Journal so that there was no confusion about Lafley’s interim status.
Allen Questrom said on TV yesterday that he is willing to be our Chairman in the event we meet certain conditions; namely, he is not willing to step into a hostile situation and he must be comfortable with the CEO we designate.
With Allen as our new Chairman, we would have the benefit of one of the great retail CEOs in assisting us in overseeing the Company at this critical time, and we would have his input and direction in selecting our next CEO, something with which he has enormous experience and relationships.
According to Bloomberg, Ackman has said he has "lost confidence" in Engibous and wants him to be replaced with Allen Questrom, the former CEO of JCPenney.

" Cramer's argument in Icahn's favor is that Apple CEO Tim Cook is too conservative.
The President is the CEO of this business that we call America.
What happened yesterday, in case you missed it, is that a famous investor named Carl Icahn announced in a Tweet that he had bought a bunch of Apple stock and had just talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook on the phone.
We also can't buy the stock knowing that we will likely be able to put ourselves firmly in the black merely by tweeting that we have bought the stock and saying that we have just had an encouraging private conversation with the company's CEO.
The second issue I have with what happened yesterday is the reminder that Apple CEO Tim Cook is wasting his time having private conversations with investors.
I realize that this is standard practice for public-company CEOs these days, but I wish it weren't.
CEOs and senior managers like Tim Cook also speak relatively frequently in public.
And what shareholder wouldn't want to have a private conversation with Apple's CEO every once in a while?
As any junior Wall Street analyst quickly learns, the way a CEO says something is often as (or more) informative than what the CEO actually says.
As the CEO of one of the world's biggest companies, Tim Cook has a lot that he could spend his time on.
These investors don't have a "right" to talk privately with the CEO of one of the world's biggest companies, especially when they own only one quarter of one percent of the company's stock.
If these investors threaten to sell their stock because the CEO won't talk to them, then let them sell their stock.
And having Apple's CEO take the time to have private conversations with Carl Icahn is not just unfair all other Apple shareholders.
But whether or not these meetings and conversations are kosher, there is still the question of whether they are a good use of a CEO's time.
Investors and stocks are going to do what they are going to do, regardless of whether a CEO spends time kissing up to investors.
As a smaller shareholder, I would far rather have the CEO of Apple spend time working on the company's products than having private conversations with bigger shareholders.

REUTERS/Rick WilkingBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett pauses during a bridge game in Omaha May 5, 2013 the day after the company's annual meeting.Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, just filed its 13F, detailing its holdings in various stocks at the end of the second quarter.
He wanted the company to hold its annual general meeting - at which he intends to try and replace the board - at the same time as the vote, hoping that will force the CEO to put his best and final offer on the table.
But Strine was dismissive of Icahn's argument that Dell Inc, and the special committee formed to review the buyout offer, was trying to push the CEO's deal at the expense of shareholders.
The broader conflict between CEO Dell and Icahn adds more uncertainty to a company that once ruled the global personal computer market, but is now trying to move into the relatively unfamiliar field of enterprise computing services as mobile devices pummel sales of computers and laptops.
But Southeastern, which holds about 4 percent of Dell's stock, argued on Friday that the results showed a strong increase in cash flows and robust growth in revenue from enterprise software and services, supporting its case that the company still had strong long-term prospects and that the CEO's proposal thereby undervalued the company.
Such a move is negative for the CEO's camp, which estimates that holders of almost a quarter of eligible shares will abstain from voting.

There hasn't been a peep from the new CEO of Bloomberg Media Group, Justin Smith, since his hire was announced.
The second case involves the son of the CEO of a company called China Everbright.
JPMorgan had never done business with the company before hiring the CEO's son, but once he was hired, China Everbright became one of the banks "prized Asian clients.
He leaked letters to the media that he had written to the board demanding that they replace interim CEO Mike Ullman and that chairman Tom Engibous resign.
The high-end makeup store that Ackman insisted on introducing to JCPenney during his extreme makeover of the retailer is the only thing CEO Mike Ullman and company could point to as a success.
As Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors pointed out, Macy's is modernizing — getting hipper and cooler the way Ackman wanted JCPenney to do it — but Macy's is doing this gradually.
But it was that meddling that JCP CEO Mike Ullman focused on from the beginning to the end of this morning's call.
His argument was that Ackman and former CEO Ron Johnsons' plan for the future of the retailer disrupted its relationship with its core, brand loyal customers.
"There's still that core Baby Boomer customer that will not change brands," said Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors.
They're referring to the "failed prior" work of former CEO Ron Johnson.
It all began when Pershing Square Capital's Bill Ackman made a big investment in the company, securing a seat on the board of directors, and bringing in Apple retail guru Ron Johnson as CEO.
Earlier this summer, Ackman pushed the board to speed up the CEO search in an ugly public battle.
Here's CEO Mike Ullman: "Since I returned to jcpenney four months ago, we have moved quickly to stabilize our business - both financially and operationally - and we have made meaningful progress in important areas of the business.

"We drove online sales growth and aggressively managed expenses during the second quarter, but this progress was offset by weakness in our retail stores and international businesses," said CEO Ron Sargent.
Furthermore, in the case of JCPenney, he's been accused of ruining the company (a sort of valid charge, since he took a big stake and urged the board to go in a disastrous direction with the hiring of Apple's retail chief as CEO) and thus destroying jobs.
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has been particularly tough on Ackman in public.

Illustration by Mike Nudelman/Photo by Fortune Live Media On the morning of Thursday, July 12, 2012, Yahoo’s interim CEO, Ross Levinsohn, still believed he was going to be named permanent CEO of the company.
The agenda for the meeting: Levinsohn was going to brief the directors on his plan for Yahoo, should he be named permanent CEO.
Loeb ran a hedge fund called Third Point, which owned more than 5 percent of Yahoo and had, only months before, forced the resignation of Yahoo’s previous CEO.
Wolf, a former president of MTV, was consulting for Third Point on media investments when Loeb asked him to join the Yahoo board and lead its search committee for a new CEO.
It was during this part of his presentation that Levinsohn began to feel the permanent Yahoo CEO job slipping away.
Wolf, the man in charge of the committee tasked with hiring a permanent CEO, began to question the wisdom of the deal.
It was obvious to several people in the room that Wolf and Wilson wanted to make sure another candidate for the CEO job would not be forced to follow through on a deal they had not negotiated.
As the interim CEO talked, Loeb stood at the back of the room and played with his BlackBerry.
Sorry, Ross, you’re not CEO anymore.” After the meeting, Barrett, the Google executive Amoroso had helped Levinsohn poach, called Levinsohn to ask how it went.
Over the weekend, Levinsohn played a guessing game with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Twitter CEO Dick Costolo.
Levinsohn now knew who Yahoo’s next CEO would be.
On Monday, July 16, four days after Levinsohn’s last board meeting, Yahoo made it official: Thirty-seven-year-old Marissa Mayer was Yahoo’s new CEO.
Now 38 years old, she is a wife, a mother, an engineer, and the CEO of a 30-billion-dollar company.
While rival CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Google wear flip-flops, hoodies, and T-shirts, Mayer wears Oscar de la Renta on the red carpet.
More importantly, so did sought-after startup CEOs like Tumblr founder David Karp, who agreed to sell his company to Yahoo for $1.1 billion.
Most CEOs of Mayer’s stature — people running multibillion-dollar public companies the size of Yahoo — are gregarious, outgoing types — the kind of person who might have been a politician if the world of business and money hadn’t beckoned.
She was removed from a council of executives that met with Google’s CEO.
" In a conference call with investors on Aug. 14, Cisco CEO John Chambers said that business across Europe, particularly Britain and Northern Europe, was showing "very positive progress.

McDonald’s CEO, Don Thompson, was awarded a big-whopper of a compensation package last year, valued at $13.8 million.
Its CEO, David Novak, received $11.3 million in compensation last year.
The total compensation of Walmart’s CEO, Michael Duke, was $20.7 million last year, up from $18.1 million in 2011.
After Johnson was forced out, the company brought back Myron Ullman, the former CEO, with whom Ackman had disagreements.

As a market observer and fan of Apple's products, however, I'm annoyed that Apple CEO Tim Cook is wasting his time talking to Icahn.
We also can't buy the stock knowing that we will likely be able to put ourselves firmly in the black merely by tweeting that we have bought the stock and saying that we have just had an encouraging private conversation with the company's CEO.
The second issue I have with the Cook-Icahn bromance is the reminder that Apple CEO Tim Cook is wasting his time having private conversations with investors.
I realize that this is standard practice for public-company CEOs these days, but I wish it weren't.
CEOs and senior managers like Tim Cook also speak relatively frequently in public.
As any junior Wall Street analyst quickly learns, the way a CEO says something is often as (or more) informative than what the CEO actually says.
As the CEO of one of the world's biggest companies, Tim Cook has a lot that he could spend his time on.
These investors don't have a right to talk privately with the CEO of one of the world's biggest companies, especially when they own only one quarter of one percent of the company's stock.
If these investors threaten to sell their stock because the CEO won't talk to them, then let them sell their stock.
And having Apple's CEO take the time to have private conversations with Carl Icahn is not just unfair all other Apple shareholders.
But whether or not these meetings and conversations are kosher, there is still the question of whether they are a good use of a CEO's time.
Investors and stocks are going to do what they are going to do, regardless of whether a CEO spends time kissing up to investors.
As a smaller shareholder, I would far rather have the CEO of Apple spend time working on the company's products than having private conversations with bigger shareholders.
In my case, it was to J.C. Parets, founder and CEO of Eagle Bay Capital.

Today activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb filed a letter with the SEC calling for William Ruprecht, the CEO of Sotheby's, to step down.
Since August, Loeb's fund, Third Point, has upped its stake in the auction house to 9.29%, but since then things have been pretty quiet — strange for an activist investor known for calling CEOs out for "tooling around" on private jets and saying that they should be kicked out of their companies "by a well worn boot planted in the backside.
Of course, this wouldn't be a love letter from Loeb if there was no mention of the CEO's lifestyle or compensation package.
Your personal holding of 152,683 shares, representing a mere 0.22% interest, is particularly noteworthy because you have been an employee of the Company since 1980 and its CEO since 2000.

One question that arose after the news broke was why Ahrendts would go from CEO of Burberry to SVP of an Apple division — a seeming step down on the corporate hierarchy.
The second is that, if Ahrendts fits into Apple's culture and does an excellent job running its retail business, she probably has a good chance to become the company's next CEO.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk might be arrogant about his Model S, but he is also realistic about the company’s share price, and he hinted at a warning Thursday that the stock is overvalued.
Nonetheless, the CEO made his point when he asserted that, “The stock price that we have is more than we any right to deserve,” and he also added the warning, “It’s difficult to predict where it goes in the short- and medium-term, but I do feel good about having the company achieved that value more in the long-term.
It’s easy to understand why the CEO is concerned over Tesla’s rising stock price, as CNN highlights that shares are up 400 percent this year and are trading at almost 100 times the company’s earnings estimates, but investors are still not exactly heeding warnings.
Back then, CEO Reed Hastings warned that the company’s stock was rising too quickly, and investors learned that the hard way when it plunged in 2004 and has been volatile ever since.
Despite the warnings, it’s safe to say that investors don’t always learn from their mistakes, and Musk just hopes he isn’t the next CEO to facilitate a disappointment.
However, it’s also important for bankers to heed warnings, especially when they’re delivered from the CEO himself.

Advocates have been quietly pushing the idea of a CEO who would set marketplace rules, coordinate with insurers and state regulators on the health plans offered for sale, supervise enrollment campaigns and oversee technology, according to several sources familiar with discussions between advocates and the Obama administration.
The White House is not embracing the idea of creating a CEO, administration officials said.
Some healthcare reform allies say the complexity of the federal marketplace requires a CEO-type figure with clear authority and knowledge of how insurance markets work.
"So my sense is that they're not thinking about appointing a CEO in the short term," said Topher Spiro, a healthcare analyst with the Center for American Progress.
The CEO proposal calls for removing day-to-day control of the marketplace from the CMS bureaucracy and placing it under a leadership structure like those used in some of the more successful state-run marketplaces, including California.
The new team would be managed by a CEO, or an executive director, who would run the marketplace like a business and answer directly to the White House, sources familiar with the discussions say.
They point to insurance industry and healthcare veterans as potential candidates, including former Aetna CEO Ronald Williams, former Kaiser Permanente CEO George Halvorson and Jon Kingsdale, who ran the Massachusetts health exchange established under former Governor Mitt Romney's 2006 healthcare reforms.

2 on Business Insider's list of the sexiest CEOs.The trick to raising your company's stock price is simple: hire a hot CEO.
While it's previously been shown that better-looking CEOs earn bigger paychecks, these attractive execs also are associated with higher stock returns and stronger gains on M&amp;A deals, according to a new research paper.
In "Beauty is Wealth: CEO Appearance and Shareholder Value," University of Wisconsin economists Joseph Halford and Scott Hsu discovered the link between attractiveness and company profitability after examining the looks of 677 people who served as CEOs of S&amp;P 500 companies between 2000 and 2012 and the performance of their companies' stocks at various points.
Attractive CEOs receive a "beauty premium.
" Halford and Hsu confirm prior research, which shows that more attractive CEOs receive higher total compensation than their less attractive peers.
Stocks rise when attractive CEOs start their jobs.
"We find that FAI has a positive and significant impact on stock returns surrounding the first day when the CEO is on the job, indicating that shareholders seem to perceive more attractive CEOs to be more valuable," Halford and Hsu write.
Attractive CEOs get larger surpluses from M&amp;A deals.
Halford and Hsu say this finding is linked to the notion that hotter CEOs are more persuasive negotiators.
Stocks rise if the company's attractive CEO appears on TV.
Having a hot CEO boosts a company's visibility and public image.
Halford and Hsu find that when attractive CEOs appear on television, their companies tend to see improved stock returns.
"The findings suggest that CEO appearance matters for shareholder value and provide an explanation why more attractive CEOs receive 'beauty premiums' in their compensation," the economists conclude.
That puts them squarely against fellow billionaire Sheldon Adelson, the CEO of Las Vegas Sands, over the future of the online gambling industry, which has spread across the country over recent years as states look to capitalize on the tax revenues.

Reuters/Chip EastFormer Tyco International Ltd. Chairman Dennis Kozlowski arrives with his wife Karen at New York Supreme court March 30, 2004.After spending more than eight years as an inmate in the New York State prison system, former Tyco International CEO Dennis Kozlowski was granted parole in December 2013.
What you may not remember is Kozlowski as the charismatic CEO who headed Tyco during the 1990s when the company grew from a small New Hampshire enterprise into a $40 billion a year global giant that employed 250,000 people and operated in more than 100 countries.
During Kozlowski's decade as CEO, Tyco successfully acquired hundreds of companies -- some for tens of billions of dollars.
Clearly, the former CEO has valuable skills, but his character has been so severely damaged by the media for more than a decade, it's going to be difficult for him to rehabilitate his image and move forward.
It will be interesting to see if the media and public opinion will allow Kozlowski to shed the caricature of the greedy CEO and move forward.

Lampert, who runs Florida based ESL Investments and is the chairman/CEO of Sears, is the largest individual shareholder the retailer.
It was a solid piece of news for CEO Michael Jeffries, whose head has been called for by some investors after a year of disappointing figures and insensitive remarks.

A raft of new research suggests not only that good-looking CEOs are paid more handsomely, but also that they're actually better for their companies in surprising ways.
Attractive CEOs have “a positive and significant impact on stock returns" when they first appear on television, according to a working paper by Joseph T. Halford and Hung-Chia Hsu at the University of Wisconsin.
"Our findings suggest that more attractive CEOs have higher compensation because they create more value for shareholders through better negotiating prowess and visibility," they said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Mary Barra, the next CEO of General Motors Co &lt;GM.N&gt;, sent a powerful message to colleagues last year when she challenged about 250 designers and engineers at GM's Vehicle Engineering Center - to a paper sailboat race.
Then-CEO Fritz Henderson shifted Barra in mid-2009 to head human resources as the corporation was undergoing a painful bankruptcy and tumultuous restructuring as part of a $49.5 billion U.S. government rescue.
She also helped new CEO Ed Whitacre, the former AT&amp;T Inc &lt;T.N&gt; chairman who replaced Henderson in late 2009, to thin GM's swollen management ranks and shuffle jobs and personnel.
" Her more than three decades of experience at GM and deep knowledge of the GM system set Barra apart from Akerson and Whitacre, the two most recent CEOs, while her extensive technical background is radically different from Henderson and Rick Wagoner, the two GM finance veterans who held the job prior to Whitacre.

flickr/EricssonFranceSAN FRANCISCO/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is considering Ericsson Chief Executive Hans  as a possible successor to outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer, Bloomberg reported, citing sources briefed on the software giant's executive search.
Both Microsoft and Ericsson declined to comment on Bloomberg's report, though a source close to the U.S. company has said that no CEO appointment is likely until the last week of January at the earliest.
"It's more logical that they will find a U.S. leader, from their network of owners, board members and experienced CEOs with a software, enterprise and media background.
But speculation refocused on internal choices this month after the leading external candidate, Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, took himself off the list.
Analysts say that Microsoft may have to look at "dark horse" candidates, but noted that some widely touted executives in the technology sector, including Pivotal Inc CEO Paul Maritz, have already declined to take the job.
In a blog post on Microsoft's website last month lead independent director John Thompson, who is spearheading the search, emphasized the need for a CEO with good technology credentials and "an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent".

The jury that saw footage from this party actually didn't end up convicting Kozwolski; the judge declared a mistrial after a juror apparently gunning for the former CEO's acquittal gave an "okay" sign to the defense.
But as the Journal noted, the ex-CEO's spending habits and big party attracted the attention of prosecutors, so it's fair to blame at least some of his downfall on the "Roman Orgy.

Another client, CEO of a medium-cap tech company, retired with a net worth in the $70M range.
The bulk of any CEO's wealth comes from stock, not income, and incomes are also very high.
Last year, the average S&amp;P 500 CEO made $9M in all forms of compensation.
The year 2010 was a record year for compensation on Wall Street, while corporate CEO compensation rose by over 30%, most Americans struggled.
When the board of JP Morgan Chase gave its blowdried, tirelessly self-regarding CEO a whopping 74 percent raise – after a year in which the Justice Department blasted the bank with $20 billion in sanctions – it was one of those rare instances where Main Street and Wall Street were mostly in agreement.
Their first move was to make sure people outside the penthouse boardroom took on all the pain, laying off 7,500 employees and freezing salaries for the non-CEO class of line employees.
It doesn't exactly send much of a message when, mere months after you've imposed record enforcement penalties, the CEO of your target company is being led down Wall Street on a donkey, board members showering him with cash.
In contrast, when the LIBOR scandal blew up in England, British authorities essentially removed Barclays CEO Bob Diamond from office right away, in addition to levying fines and other penalties.
Adam Hartung at Forbes put it this way, in his critique of the Chase board's decision: The Board of a troubled bank with billions in trading losses and billions in fines for illegal behavior decided to withhold employee pay raises, but double the CEO compensation, in order to snub the nose of the regulators who have been pointing out years of unethical, if not illegal, behavior?
For example, if a bank is hit with scandal after scandal over the course of a year, the CEO of the bank doesn't take home a fat check for his work.
That's what Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins will do for the second year in a row, saying goodbye to a $4.4 million payout, the Daily Mail reports.
You'll recall that Jenkins replaced Bob Diamond as CEO of Barclays in August 2012 after the bank was investigated for its involvement in rigging the benchmark Libor interest rate.
Basically what Jenkins is saying is — "I can't take a bonus until we stop paying for our own nasty mistakes because I am accountable for those mistakes as CEO of this bank.
It's hard not to compare that to what we saw happen to JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's compensation, which almost doubled from $11.5 million to $20 million despite the fact that the bank paid out over $20 billion in fines to regulators in 2013.

As HP's stock rebounds back to the near-$30 mark, where it was trading before HP hired CEO Meg Whitman in 2011, Whitman got a nice raise in 2013.
There's also been plenty of drama so far under her helm, including accusations of alleged accounting fraud at Autonomy, the $11 billion big-data software company that HP acquired shortly before Whitman was named CEO; a huge multiyear 34,000-job layoff; and a shakeup of the board that caused two board members to resign and one to step down as chairman.
But we can't help compare Whitman's $260,000 bonus with IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's decision not to pay IBM senior execs their cash bonuses for 2013, thanks to IBM's shrinking revenues and profits.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidFormer CEO of Dow Jones, Lex Fenwick speaks during an interview in his New York offices July 20, 2012.
When Fenwick's departure was announced on January 21, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement that the company was reviewing its institutional strategy and planning improvements to DJX.
Fenwick, a 25-year veteran of Bloomberg LP, was appointed Dow Jones CEO in February 2012 and assigned with fixing the troubled institutional part of Dow Jones' business that was losing market share to competitors such as Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters Corp. His overhaul came at a difficult time in the marketplace, with banks under pressure to cut costs.
When Fenwick was CEO of Bloomberg from 2001 to 2008, he was praised for doubling revenue to $6 billion, though he was also criticized for being abrasive and mercurial.
Dow Jones' interim CEO, William Lewis, said in a staff memo that it was a "clear priority" to review the company's institutional strategy.

Ebay has released a response to Carl Icahn's brutal shred of its board this morning, writing that Icahn "cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context" to attack board members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook, and CEO John Donahoe.
And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.
He writes that the CEO John Donahoe "seems to be completely asleep or, even worse, either naive or willfully blind.
How is it possible for the current board to engage in any meaningful discussions about long-term stockholder value while: (1) at least two board members are directly competing with eBay, (2) one board member is demanding eBay cease hiring the most talented employees, (3) another board member is routinely funding competitors while buying companies from eBay and reaping significant personal riches, (4) at least two board members appear to have put their own financial gain in ongoing conflict with their fiduciary responsibilities to stockholders and (5) the CEO seems to be completely asleep or, even worse, either naive or willfully blind to these grave lapses of accountability and stockholder value destruction?
The Board’s Transgressions and CEO Mr. John Donahoe’s Ineptitude in Addressing Them Mr. Marc Andreessen – Independent Director Since Mr. Andreessen has been an eBay insider, he has engaged in several transactions that lead us to question his loyalty to eBay.
(12) Mr. Scott Cook – Independent Director and Member of the Corporate Governance &amp; Nominating Committee Mr. Cook is the founder, former CEO and a current board member of Intuit Inc. Mr. Cook has retained almost $1 billion of Intuit stock (~100x the $9 million of eBay stock he owns).
The more applicable facts show that not only from the time Mr. Donahoe took over as CEO, but also since the beginning of 2013, the stock has dramatically underperformed its applicable peers.
In an environment where an accomplished leader such as Scott Thompson, the former CEO of Yahoo, is dismissed for adding two words, Computer Science, to a degree from Stonehill College(27), it is incredible that so many blatant indiscretions at eBay have been tolerated by Mr. Donahoe and the other board members.

For the last several weeks, a firestorm has been raging between eBay and activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been blasting the company's CEO and its board members, particularly the famed Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen.
Not only has CEO John Donahoe staunchly insisted that the two company's will not split, but today eBay rejected both of Icahn's board member nominees in its preliminary proxy statement for its annual meeting.
eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.
eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a "false and misleading" attack: John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008.
In these letters, he's been slamming some of the e-commerce giant's board members and its CEO.
This time the billionaire activist investor writes that he believes eBay's CEO has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his "incompetence.

Stephen Lam/ReutersFacebook CEO Mark ZuckerbergCan’t stand the big boss at work?
Employees at these companies claim to have three of America’s most beloved CEOs.
The 2014 Highest-Rated CEOs report relied solely on the input of employees who elected to participate anonymously in an online company review survey.
Respondents were asked to rate their CEO and say whether or not they approve of the way he or she is leading the company.
To be eligible for the final ranking, each CEO had to have at least 100 approval ratings, senior management ratings, and company ratings between February 2013 and February 2014.
“There are some common traits that these highest-rated CEOs share,” says Scott Dobroski, Glassdoor’s community expert.
“For instance, we see that employees say these CEOs communicate clearly on where the company is headed, how it’s going to get there, and how each employee plays a vital role on this path, along with being accessible, personable, and transparent to employees.
These CEOs also know how to motivate their employees and rally the troops to get the job done.” Dobroski says there’s a strong correlation between highly rated CEOs and high employment satisfaction at their respective companies.
“This isn’t necessarily a surprise because leadership and company culture comes from the top down, starting with the CEO.
When employees approve of the way their CEO is leading the company, it tends to mean that they respect them, appreciate them, and want to work hard for them, which can lead to business success and growth.” FREE AppDownload

ReutersTaking a bite out of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's $78.4 million compensation wouldn't help anyone much.Last weekend the New York Times published its annual list of executive compensation, with Oracle’s Larry Ellison topping the charts at $78.4 million (and Disney’s Bob Iger in a distant second, at $34.3 million).
Fifty years ago the ratio of average CEO comp to average salaries was 24-to-1; now it is 204-to-1.
Many business scholars believe tying so much of CEO comp to stock and the performance of a company’s shares incentivizes CEOs to make quarterly earnings look good whether or not it benefits the company’s long-term health.
Capital everywhere—from the corporate CEO in the U.S. to industrial titans in India to party leaders in China—is reaping the greatest rewards of global economic growth.
Altering CEO pay structures would do little to alter that trajectory.
The top 100 CEOs in the survey took home a total of $1.5 billion.
Ballooning CEO pay is in turn a product of the globalization of capital, labor, and business (as Piketty highlights) without a commensurate evolution of some sort of global government and tax regime.
Almost all of the companies that employ the top-paid CEOs are increasingly multinational and answer to no single government.
CEOs are paid egregiously; many, many people barely earn enough.
A couple items are critical, such as efficient customer acquisition and a magnetic CEO that people follow.

JC Penney, for example, paid its former CEO Ron Johnson 1,795 times the average wage and benefits of a U.S. department store worker.

casino magnate Steve Wynn, head of Wynn Resorts Ltd and Wynn Macau Ltd, speaks during a news conference in Macau, June 5, 2012.Perhaps for Steve Wynn’s next Wynn Resorts’ commercial he’ll begin with his trademark, “Hello, I’m Steve Wynn,” and then add, “I made $19.6 million in total compensation in 2013 as chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts.” Skift examined the financial filings of publicly listed hotel companies and came up with a list of the Top 10 Hotel CEO Pay Packages of 2013 [see below], ranging from top-earner Steve Wynn’s $19.6 million to Hilton Worldwide CEO Christopher Nassetta’s $2.26 million at number 10.
Before you feel sorry for Nassetta’s base salary of a mere $850,000 and $2.26 million in total compensation in 2013 (both lowest among the top 10) as the chain’s president and CEO, consider that he signed a new employment agreement in February 2014 growing out of Hilton’s successful 2013 IPO, which raised $2.35 billion.
As Wynn Resorts noted in a financial filing dealing with 2013 executive compensation, its “compensation committee is mindful that gaming companies have historically provided total compensation packages that may be higher than many of then non-gaming counterparts due to the unique blend of entrepreneurial and managerial skills required to be successful in gaming and certain regulatory and other extraordinary demands.” Gaming CEOs And that trend held true among the Top 10 Hotel CEO Pay Packages in 2013 as the CEOs of gaming companies, including Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts (No.
4, $10.9 million) took three out of the four top slots, with Wyndham Worldwide chairman and CEO Stephen Holmes squeezing in at No.
It should be noted, however, that Starwood president and CEO Frits van Paasschen’s $10,913,694 total compensation package for 2013 placed him fifth among hotel CEOs, although he was in a virtual dead heat with James Murren, chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts, who earned $10,991,426 at No.
He’s Definitely Wynning Steve Wynn achieved his status as 2013's most highly compensated hotel CEO not just for his chairman and CEO duties, but also because he’s a marketing tool.
Wyndham CEO Helped Beat Performance Targets Wyndham chairman and CEO Stephen Holmes took the No.
3 position, and was the top earner among the non-casino hotel company CEOs with a 2013 total compensation package of $13.5 million, and this included $5.25 million in stock awards, $1.75 million in option awards, and $4.27 million in non-equity incentive compensation.
Oh, Marriott Among other points of interest in the Top 10 Hotel CEO Pay Packages in 2013 was Marriott president and CEO Arne Sorenson’s $9.16 million compensation.
GMI also found fault with the fact that Marriott doesn’t disclose performance targets, doesn’t necessarily figure Sorenson’s base pay after conducting external reviews, and can give its CEO long-term incentive pay “for below-median performance,” Marriott says.

Icahn's piece slams Buffett for not standing up for what's right: My colleagues and I have fought long and hard to change fellow board members' attitudes and beliefs concerning their responsibility to shareholders, even if this change angers the CEO and some of his cronies sitting on the board.
But if a man of Warren Buffett's stature openly states he abstains from voting on plans he doesn't agree with because he "loves" management and he doesn't want to "express any disapproval," how can we expect other board members in this country to voice their opinions, especially if they are opposed to the CEO's interest?
But if this is taken to its logical conclusion, you should not vote no, even if you are diametrically opposed to what the CEO and certain of his crony board members want.

However, it's stunning to see how much faster CEO pay has increased relative to the average worker's pay.
In 2013, the average Fortune 500 CEO made 331 times as much as the average worker, according to the AFL-CIO's "Executive Paywatch" project.
AFL-CIO provided Business Insider with data on the historical trends of CEO pay going back in five year increments to 1983, which we show on the following chart.
The ratio of CEO pay to worker pay has blown up in the last thirty years.
In 1983, the average CEO made 46 times the pay of the average worker, and this ratio would skyrocket through the boom years of the 90s, with CEOs making 455 times what workers made.
After the tech boom receded, the CEO to worker ratio leveled off somewhat, but has risen a little in the last few years.

United TherapeuticsMartine Rothblatt, Founder and CEO of United TherapeuticsNext time you're contemplating the pay gap between male and female executives, put this one in your pipe: The highest-paid woman CEO was born a man.
That's what the New York Times' Claire Cain Miller observed in her recent article about a study of CEO pay.
The CEO in question is named Martine Rothblatt.
Then she founded United Therapeutics in 1996 and has served as its CEO ever since.
That $38 million put Ms. Rothblatt a fair ways above the second-highest paid woman CEO on the New York Times' list, Marissa Mayer of Yahoo.
And, in fact, the average female CEO on the list makes only $1.6 million less than the average male CEO (a statistical wash, apparently, once you adjust for relative ages and experience).
But Rothblatt and Mayer are two of only 11 female CEOs on the list.
The rest of the 200 companies with market values over $1 billion, the 189 other CEOs, are men.
In other words, only 6% of CEOs at the top 200 companies are women.
More of the 11 female CEOs in the top 200 are in tech than in any other industry.
And these women CEOs make more, on average, than their male counterparts.

REUTERS/Denis BalibouseThis is a buying opportunity.David Yermack, a finance professor at New York University, has written a wonderful paper showing a correlation between the times CEOs take private jets to their vacation homes and movements in the company's stock.
It is, perhaps, not surprising that CEOs go on vacation after announcing good news, and that they stay in the office when bad news is announced — propelling their stock up and down, respectively.
It means you can buy or sell stock based on when a CEO hits the golf course.
Yermack then used property records to identify CEO vacation homes, and made the assumption that when a corporate jet landed at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, or Key Largo, Florida, that it was for vacation purposes and not a merger negotiation.
Here's his conclusion: I find that CEOs go to their vacation homes just after companies report favorable news, and CEOs return to headquarters right before subsequent news is released.
More good news is released when CEOs are back at work, and CEOs appear not to leave headquarters at all if a firm has adverse news to disclose.
When CEOs are away from the office, stock prices behave quietly with sharply lower volatility.
Volatility increases immediately when CEOs return to work.
Mandatory Form 8-K disclosures of material company news are more likely to be filed late if news occurs while CEOs are at their vacation homes.
As an example, Yermack produced this chart of the travels of Boeing CEO W. James McNerney Jr., who owns a vacation home in Hobe Sound, Florida, 34 miles from the Palm Beach airport.
Boeing's chairman and CEO, according to real estate records.
And, yes, you could trade on the information, Yermack says: The movements of company aircraft to and from CEOs' vacation residences provide visible signals of pending news announcements and silences.
With a trivial amount of research and monitoring, investors could observe flights of corporate aircraft in real time between the headquarters airport and CEOs' vacation locales, either by watching live FAA data on the Internet or stationing scouts for tailspotting of the tail numbers of planes that land at leisure airports favored by CEOs such as Nantucket, Massachusetts or Naples, Florida.
This information could support straightforward trading strategies, such as using derivatives to bet on declines in volatility when a CEO arrives at his vacation airport and increases in volatility when he departs.
In defense of CEOs, Yermack also found that CEO don't actually take much vacation: 17 days a year on average — the same as middle managers.
She said that that lunch just happened to be on the same day that then-Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit was supposed to call her.

Reuters/Robert GalbraithOracle CEO Larry Ellison celebrates a yacht racing win.Average CEO pay in the United States' biggest companies has been increasing at a moderate rate over the past few years, rising to $11.4 million in 2013, according to a new Wall Street Journal report.
According to the Associated Press and Equilar, the median pay package of CEOs of S&amp;P 500 companies was 257 times more than the salary of their average employee, up from 181 times more in 2009.
But even though a top CEO's annual pay package may still be an unfathomable amount of money for most people, defenders of this recent increase in pay think anger toward it is misguided.
They say that it is largely the result of a healthy stock market and also point to the fact that a large majority of shareholders, those who want to avoid losing money on poorly performing executives, approve of how much their companies' CEOs are making.
"As the public cried for executives' pay to be tied to performance, that trend has very much happened," says Kevin Scott, co-founder/CEO of branding consulting firm the ADDO Institute.
"And now, as their stocks are performing at very high levels, those CEOs are reaping the benefits.
Companies' boards have responded to this regulation, and there has been a trend toward basing CEO compensation on how well a company is doing in the market relative to its competition.
U.S. stocks are at all-time highs, and so it follows that many CEOs of the nation's biggest corporations are making more money than they were a few years ago.
Furthermore, inequality is down from the boom years of the late 90s, where the average pay of an S&amp;P 500 CEO hit a high of 350 times that of the median household income, according to the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.
He believes, however, that although there are of course exceptions, CEOs' pay packages are not the result of greed and excess, and argues that CEO pay should be compared with the salaries of other high-earning professionals: "If you look at CEO pay compared to the average pay of people in the top 0.1%, it's about where it was 20 years ago — in line with [that of] lawyers and private-company executives, and less than hedge-fund managers," he said last year.
Kaplan also believes that there's a bigger gap in pay between big corporations' CEOs and their employees than in the 60s, 70s, or 80s partially because technology has allowed executives to control more profitable, global companies.
Essentially, Kaplan thinks CEO pay of the nation's biggest corporations is generally fair and justified, and paying them less would not somehow raise the standard of the lower and middle classes.
ADDO's CEO Scott believes that if shareholders are happy with a board's executive compensation and the company is making money, then executives are incentivized to work harder and the company should have higher returns.
But when CEOs focus on creating value ... and compensation follows, then everyone wins," Scott says.
For example, in early April, 93% of companies in the Russell 3000 index approved of their CEO's pay.
Those who are still outraged over CEOs' compensation want government intervention and a shift in focus from a company's shareholders and board to its employees.
The senators' bill would have reduced the tax rate for companies in which the CEO's pay is less than 100 times that of a median employee, and increased on a sliding scale up to 13% for those that passed the barrier.
ADDO's CEO Scott thinks that non-shareholders shouldn't be telling boards how much a CEO is worth.
"Individuals who have no affiliation with a business or a brand — their opinion should not factor into a CEO's compensation package.
In a conference call on Thursday announcing the move, CEO Elon Musk said he believes a company's relying on patents is a sign of weakness: "It means they're not innovating," he said.
In the past year, Lululemon has hired several new executives, including CEO Laurent Potdevin.

The average CEO of a big American corporation made 20 times more than a typical employee in the same industry in 1965.
Today, the average CEO is making almost 300 times more, according to a new report from the Economic Policy Institute.
The following chart shows how the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio rose dramatically in the boom years of the late 90s and has generally remained quite high since.
Today, CEOs earn about 300 times more than their employees:  CEO pay in the late 60s and 70s grew despite a bad market, continued growing and even exceeded the growth of the booming market in 2000.
The fall of the market had CEO compensation pare back significantly, though by 2007 pay had worked its way back up to 2000 levels.
But while a healthy market has brought more money to CEOs at high performing companies, the lower and middle classes have struggled with low wages and high unemployment.

U.S. stocks are at all-time highs, and so it follows that many CEOs of the nation's biggest corporations are making more money than they were a few years ago.
Furthermore, inequality is down from the boom years of the late 90s, where the average pay of an S&amp;P 500 CEO hit a high of 350 times that of the median household income, according to the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.
He believes, however, that although there are of course exceptions, CEOs' pay packages are not the result of greed and excess, and argues that CEO pay should be compared with the salaries of other high-earning professionals: "If you look at CEO pay compared to the average pay of people in the top 0.1%, it's about where it was 20 years ago — in line with [that of] lawyers and private-company executives, and less than hedge-fund managers," he said last year.
Kaplan also believes that there's a bigger gap in pay between big corporations' CEOs and their employees than in the 60s, 70s, or 80s partially because technology has allowed executives to control more profitable, global companies.
Essentially, Kaplan thinks CEO pay of the nation's biggest corporations is generally fair and justified, and paying them less would not somehow raise the standard of the lower and middle classes.
ADDO's CEO Scott believes that if shareholders are happy with a board's executive compensation and the company is making money, then executives are incentivized to work harder and the company should have higher returns.
But when CEOs focus on creating value ... and compensation follows, then everyone wins," Scott says.
For example, in early April, 93% of companies in the Russell 3000 index approved of their CEO's pay.
Those who are still outraged over CEOs' compensation want government intervention and a shift in focus from a company's shareholders and board to its employees.
The senators' bill would have reduced the tax rate for companies in which the CEO's pay is less than 100 times that of a median employee, and increased on a sliding scale up to 13% for those that passed the barrier.
ADDO's CEO Scott thinks that non-shareholders shouldn't be telling boards how much a CEO is worth.
"Individuals who have no affiliation with a business or a brand — their opinion should not factor into a CEO's compensation package.

Michael J. Cooper, Huseyin Gulen, P. Raghavendra RauCumulative abnormal returns to the firms that are in the top and bottom deciles of annually ranked excess CEO incentive compensation distribution over 1994-2011 are plotted in event time.You might think that investing in companies with the highest paid CEOs would be your best bet.
Professors Michael J. Cooper, Huseyin Gulin, and P. Raghavendra Rau teamed up to examine the relationship between the CEO incentive compensation and the future stock price performance of his/her company.
According to their research, CEO pay is negatively related to future stock returns for up to three years after sorting on pay.
In other words, the more CEOs get paid, the worse the stock performs.
Their findings show that CEOs in the upper 10% of pay earn “negative abnormal returns” of approximately 8% for the next three years.
Additionally, this negative correlation is even stronger for CEOs who receive higher incentive pay compared to their peers.
Cooper, Gulen, and Rau suggest that these enormous salaries lead to overconfidence by the CEO.

According to CYNK's last filing with the SEC, which also said the company would no longer be filing financial reports with the SEC, the company's CEO is listed as Miguel Luis Sanchez.
" In filings made with the OTC Market, the company lists Javier Romero as its CEO, saying that Sanchez resigned as CEO of the company on February 20 of this year.
CYNK Technology Filings It seems Romero, like Sanchez before him, serves as not only the company's CEO, but also its president, secretary, treasurer, director.
But CEO change at the company is not a new phenomenon.
Sanchez stepping away from CYNK makes him the third CEO, who also served as the company's only employee, to walk away.
Kenneth Carter, who goes by "Kenny Blaque," was formerly the CEO and sole employee of CYNK Technology, then known as Introbuzz, when the company filed an S-1 with the SEC announcing its intent to go public.
Hyman added that Carter told her he hasn't met Sanchez, or John Kueber, the first CEO of the company, according to OTC Market filings.
" The company's S-1, however, clearly indicates that Carter was the company's CEO, CFO, accounting officer, secretary, treasurer and director at the time of the filing.

The company's CEO, Genaro Garcia, also resigned after telling the company's board that its financials over at least the last four years were falsified.
Last month Las Vegas lawyer Harold P. Gewerter, who formerly represented CYNK and has worked with multiple businesses linked to the company's executives wrote a letter to OTC Markets Group indicating a Belizean man named Javier Romero became CYNK's CEO on Feb. 20.
A filing with OTC Markets, the platform where CYNK was traded, described Romero as "the President, CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director of CYNK Technologies, Inc." and said, "since 2009 Mr. Romero has been a Fisheries Officer for the Government of Belize.
In those conversations, Romero denied being involved in the company or knowing any of its executives although he admitted there was a "proposed transaction" for him to purchase shares from a former CYNK CEO.
Documents show the company's first CEO was a man named John Kueber, who is currently the chief operating officer of Tiger Oak Media in Seattle.
In October 2011, a man named Kenneth Carter bought 6 million shares of CYNK and became the company's next CEO and sole employee.
" A month after Carter's resignation, in another filing, CYNK said Marlon Luis Sanchez had become CEO, taking a 72% share in the company.
The next person to lead the company was a man named Javier Romero, who was identified in a filing with OTC Markets, the platform where CYNK is traded, which described him as "the President, CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director of CYNK Technologies, Inc." and noted that "since 2009 Mr. Romero has been a Fisheries Officer for the Government of Belize.
According to the research on this now delicate situation, one Javier Romero was CEO of CYNK Technology from May 9, 2014 to June 18, 2014, served as an interim President, Secretary and Director of CYNK Technologies," said Romero.
He served as CFO and treasurer of a company called IC Places Inc., which was led by chairman and CEO Steven "Steve" Samblis.
The companies said the deal is expected to close in October, and will create, "an industry leader with the ability to deliver more capabilities from a broad global platform to reach more clients in more industry end markets,” said Michael Burke, AECOM president and CEO.
Business Insider has had several conversations with a Belizean man named Javier Romero whose name and career history match descriptions of one of CYNK's CEOs.
CYNK has had a handful of CEOs since it was founded in 2008.
" A filing with OTC Markets, the platform where CYNK is traded, described Romero as "the President, CEO, Secretary, Treasurer, and Director of CYNK Technologies, Inc." and said "since 2009 Mr. Romero has been a Fisheries Officer for the Government of Belize.
" On Friday, Business Insider had a telephone conversation with a man named Javier Romero who appeared to match the description of the CYNK CEO.
Romero, who said he consulted with a lawyer prior to the second call, also noted it appeared "one Javier Romero was CEO of CYNK Technology from May 9, 2014 to June 18, 2014" and said he had no knowledge of the company.
However, in spite of denying he had even heard of CYNK prior to the firestorm after its stock price surged, Romero indicated there was a "proposed transaction" that would have involved him purchasing shares from the company's prior CEO, Marlon Luis Sanchez.
According to the research on this now delicate situation, one Javier Romero was CEO of CYNK Technology from May 9, 2014 to June 18, 2014, served as an interim President, Secretary and Director of CYNK Technologies," said Romero.
Though he admitted there was a "proposed transaction" for him to purchase shares from Sanchez, the former CYNK CEO, Romero claimed he did not know anyone affiliated with the company.
It is unclear why the man named Javier Romero who spoke to Business Insider and matched much of the description of the person identified as CYNK's CEO said he was entirely unaware of the company while also saying there was a "proposed transaction" between him and Sanchez.

SkiftVirgin America Founding CEO Fred ReidEditor's note: Virgin America filed for an IPO this morning.
Thanks to our friends at Skift for letting us run the following interview with former Virgin America CEO Fred Reid.
Fred Reid knows a thing or two about the airline business and passenger experience, and believes that “Virgin America has proven that technology plus style plus design plus ease of use plus people, people, people, people can launch an airline.”  As the founding CEO of Virgin America, a post he left in late 2007, Reid says he banned the use of words such as “passenger” and “employee” in favor of “guest” and “teammate,” and you’ll see from the Skift interview below that he did so for substantive reasons that go to the core success or failure of an airline, and not just for public relations spin.

Thomson ReutersOracle Corp CEO Ellison introduces the Oracle Database In-Memory during a launch event in Redwood ShoresBy Jeffrey Dastin and Sam Adams NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Larry Ellison sailed off on his yacht for good tomorrow, who would really run Oracle Corp ?
The question is on investors' minds after Ellison, 70, promoted both Catz and sales leader Mark Hurd to the CEO position on Thursday, while taking on the role of executive chairman and chief technology officer himself.
"In a CEO cage match it's pretty even, but I give Safra extra credit for her years of service with the company," said Kim Forrest at Fort Pitt Capital.
" Only one analyst said Hurd was the more likely to lead the company, chiefly because he is the one with experience of being the CEO of a large technology company.
One analyst said neither would likely be CEO, echoing sentiments that Ellison does not fully back either candidate to solely run the company he co-founded 37 years ago and built into a $40 billion-a-year giant.
Most analysts think the co-CEO arrangement should work in the short term, but questions remain over how long it will last.
"I don't know the timing - it could be three, it could be five years - there may be one (CEO) down the road," said  Gartner analyst Chad Eschinger.

Patrick Riviere/GettyBusinessman Sir Richard Branson is LinkedIn's top "social" CEO.
Most CEOs sense that social media marks an important breakthrough for business communications, but they aren’t sure how to fully utilize the technology to gain a competitive advantage.
This surprising finding comes from the 2014 Global Social CEO Survey by Brandfog, a social media consulting firm for CEOs.
To succeed as a next-generation social CEO, business leaders need to engage more with their internal teams, partners and customers.
This is the challenge most CEOs face regarding social, whether they realize it or not.
For social to work in the C-suite, CEOs can use crowdsourcing software or new “actionable social” tools to solicit feedback from large groups.
CEOs also need to manage which audiences participate in each initiative, doing away with the social free-for-all.
All of this so important to CEOs.
According to the Brandfog survey, 83 percent of senior leaders think CEOs who actively participate in social media can build better connections with their customers, employees and investors.
These important benefits make up the intrinsic value of being a social CEO, while raising serious doubts about any laggards who continue to shun social media.
The company’s CEO said on Tuesday that the dispute could mean the firm would have to scrap the launch of its new low-cost airline.

Here's our Q&amp;A: BI: What responsibility do you think the CEO of Wells Fargo has to address inequality?
Specifically, it helps explain why so much of what a CEO gets paid is tied to performance and tied up in things like stock options.
The CEO gets what seems like a lot, but knowing that he can ask for more next year makes it important that that compensation is tied to how well the company is doing.
The second implication is that executive compensation usually doesn't have a lot to do with how the company does when she's gone from the company, although some CEOs do continue to get bonuses after they retire.

The proportion of female CEOs at companies listed on the main Nordic bourses is one percent - below the already paltry EU average of three percent.
Only 12 percent of their CEOs or managing directors are female, compared with a rate of 17 percent for the EU.
Harald Norvik, a former Statoil CEO, said more women were moving now into a wider section of industries, something which needed to continue in order to widen the pool of potential top management candidates.
"There are few female CEOs mainly because few females have been a long time in line (management) positions," he said.
Women who do go into the private sector often shorten their chances of making it to interviews for the top jobs by working in areas like human resources, communications and marketing, which do not typically yield CEO or board candidates, noted AllBright's Lundeteg.

Mike NudelmanSo you got funded and you're the CEO — oddly terrifying, really, that you should be so unprepared for the biggest job of your life.
As CEO what do you do and not do?
Often companies come unglued at the top when first-time CEOs exercise their right to freely invade, well, anything and everything.
The tendency to meddle comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the CEO job.
As CEO, talk about people all the time.
Lastly, establish a calendar buddy, someone preferably who is a CEO also, in an unrelated industry.
Mike Nudelman Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square likens the CEO job, and leadership generally, to an editorial task: editing for great ideas and people, and editing out the bad.
I like this metaphor but would add that the CEO needs to be alert for contrarian opportunities.
When things are bad, the CEO is the single most important voice reassuring everyone that there will be better days.
One reason you are CEO is that you are a doer, a person of action.
Employees mirror the mood of the CEO more than they should, but it's a fact.
One of the places where CEO interference, if you will, should be tolerated is in removing distraction.

In his characteristic iconoclastic style with a generous use of ironic humour, Montier labelled shareholder value maximization, the way Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE, had once described it in 2009, “the dumbest idea in the world.” An academic opinion without much evidence  Montier said that the idea of shareholder value maximization didn’t come from businesses but rather originated as an opinion in academia, unsupported by much evidence.
Montier gave the example of Business Roundtable (BRT), an association of CEOs of major US companies.
Despite enormous increases in compensation of CEOs and a rising proportion of financial incentives through stock ownership and options, shareholders are not better off.
Under the mantra of shareholder value maximization, CEOs are now being paid more than ever before and about two-thirds of that compensation is in the form of stock ownership and stock options.
Call options, which only pay off if stock prices rise, encourage short-term gaming by CEOs rather than long-term value creation.
Montier believes that rather than focusing on the long-term prosperity of their businesses, CEOs are focusing on how much more money they can make if they can game the system.
The life span of a S&amp;P 500 company has decreased from more than 26 years in 1971–1976 to close to 15 years in 2005–2010, and tenure of a CEO has shrunk from 10 years to 6 years.

Andrew Kelly/ReutersJeff Bezos of Amazon.There are no guarantees in the world of investing, but it's no mystery why so many tenured investors strongly consider the quality of a company's CEO before buying its shares.
To be sure, the effective leadership — or lack thereof — of any given CEO is arguably one of the biggest influences of a company's ability to create shareholder value.
Consider the latest issue of Harvard Business Review, which did exactly that through its annual "Best-Performing CEOs in the World" report.
For this year's list, HBR started by taking the names of the current CEOs of every company in the S&amp;P Global 1200, which covers 70% of the world's stock market capitalization and consists of firms from North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Australia.
Next, they excluded CEOs who had been arrested or convicted of a crime.
Then, to ensure they had data that was both reliable and long-term in nature, they excluded CEOs who started in their role before 1995 or after April 30, 2012.
That left them with 832 top CEO candidates from 827 companies (several had co-CEOs).
For this, they used a combination of three metrics: Of course, the post-1995 requirement notably eliminates Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, who many consider to be both the most effective investor and CEO alive today.
According to HBR, however, the top 50 CEOs in their list delivered even greater total shareholder returns averaging 1,350%.
But in the end, one CEO's performance stood far above the rest: Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com.
