    "\n",
    "* Let $e_s, e_t$ be the edges with the maximum weight in $S$ and $T$ respectively. If we add an edge to a MST, we get a cycle as we have $n$ edges for $n$ nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $e_s$ was part of a cycle in the original graph $G$, then there exists an edge $f$ in some $T$ such that if we add $f$ to $S$ we get a cycle $e_s, f \\in C$. Since we can delete $e_s$ from $C$ and stil have a spanning tree with $f$ and $t(f) < t(e_s)$, we have a spanning tree with a lower cost than the MST. Therefore, $S$ could not have been a MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the other hand, if $e_s$ was not part of a cycle in the original graph $G$, then $e_s$ cut $G$ and has to be in every spanning tree. Therefore, $\\max\\limits_{e \\in S} t(e) = \\max\\limits_{e \\in T} t(e)$ since both contain $e_s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* By contradiction, we showed that $\\max\\limits_{e \\in S} t(e) > \\max\\limits_{e \\in T} t(e)$ cannot hold. Therefore, we have $\\max\\limits_{e \\in S} t(e) \\leq \\max\\limits_{e \\in T} t(e)$ and every MST of $G$ minimizes $\\max\\limits_{e \\in S} t(e)$, the maximum time any employee spends shoveling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Therefore, our approach is <b>fair</b> and also <b>connected</b> as an MST has to span all the nodes in $G$."
